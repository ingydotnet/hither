== Creating a PG User

If you are simply playing around with Hither and PostgreSQL, you should
probably create a pguser that matches your `$USER`. Run these commands:

  sudo -u postgres createuser -s -d -r $USER
  createdb

You can also run commands as the `postgres` user:

  sudo -u postgres psql

Maybe setup these aliases:

    alias psql='sudo -u postgres psql '
    alias pg_dump='sudo -u postgres pg_dump '

== Common Commandline Operations

- Start postgres shell as `postgres` admin user:


- Connect to 'hither' db

    psql -d hither

- Run a single db command

    psql -c <command>

- Load database from dump:

    psql <dbname> -f dump.sql

- Dump database:

    dg_dump <dbname> > dump.sql

    -t <table>   # specific table
    -a           # data only
    -s           # schema only

== Common Postgres Shell Commands

- `\?`

  Help for all `\` commands

- `\l`
